# Privacy Policy for Similar Repos

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-01

## 1. Introduction

Thank you for using Similar Repos ("we," "us," or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information of our users. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your data when you use our browser extension.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

We do not collect, store, or sell your personal data.

The core philosophy of Similar Repos is privacy-first. We do not have our own servers to store your browsing history, API keys, or personal information.

### 2.1 API Keys

* **Storage:** Your AI Provider API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek) are stored locally on your device using your browser's local storage capabilities (`chrome.storage.local`).
* **Transmission:** Your API keys are strictly used to authenticate requests directly from your browser to the AI provider you selected. They are never sent to us or any other third parties.

### 2.2 Browsing Data

To generate recommendations, the extension reads the content of the GitHub repository page you are currently visiting (specifically the repository name, description, and README content).

* This specific non-personal data is sent directly to your chosen AI Provider (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate the response.
* We do not track your browsing history or the repositories you visit.

## 3. Third-Party Services (AI Providers)

This extension acts as a client that interfaces with third-party AI services. When you use this extension, data (such as the repository context) is sent to the AI provider you have configured.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the AI providers you choose to use:

* OpenAI Privacy Policy
* Anthropic Privacy Policy
* Google Gemini Privacy Policy
* DeepSeek Privacy Policy

We are not responsible for the data handling practices of these third-party providers.

## 4. Data Security

Since we do not collect or store your data on our servers, there is no risk of a data breach from our side. Your API keys are stored within your browser's secure storage environment, which is sandboxed and accessible only by this extension.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
